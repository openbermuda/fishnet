Rasberry Pi
===========

The raspberry pi is a small, low cost, low power, computer.  There are
several different models, ranging in price from $5 to $35.

Playing with these is like playing with lego computers.  You can plug
things into them: sensors, lights, displays and lots more.

There is simple software to work with all these components.  The
software is getting simpler.

Astro pi
========

The Astro Pi or Sense Hat is one component you can plug in.  It has a
pressure sensor, a humidity sensor, a compass and accelerometer.  It
also has an 8x8 colour LED display that is simple to program.  You can
display banner messages or low resolution images.  There is also a
tiny joystick that you can use to give input to the pi.

The Pi 3 has just been announced.  It has built in wifi and a
bluetooth chip too.  I hear it is more powerful than the 2, which is
already a powerful machine for the power consumption.
